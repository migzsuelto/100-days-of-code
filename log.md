# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: June 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wrap up the weather application

**Time consumed**: 4h

**Thoughts:** Finish working on the weather application. We tackled about accessing API from the browser and application deployment. Git and deployment using Heroku was explained really well. It was simple explanation how it works. Just to summarize: So far we explored Express learning to serve Json and HTML, templating engines using handlebars and allowing asynchronous code allowing to fetch api via the browser.

### Day 9: June 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continue Web servers in Node.js

**Time consumed**: 1h

**Thoughts:** We we're able to setup partials using handlebars and do a bit of styling to make the application more presentable.

### Day 8: June 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start Web servers in Node.js

**Time consumed**: 1h

**Thoughts:** Finally was able to start using Express. It was smart enough of Andrew Mead to explain the fundamentals first before diving into Express. I was impatient at first to jump to Express but was thankful enough that it did not happen.

### Day 7: June 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Basic Asynchronous programming in Node.js

**Time consumed**: 1h

**Thoughts:** Learned how call stack, node api, event loop and call back queue works. Having a visual really helped.

### Day 4: May 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Node.js File System and Command Line args

**Time consumed**: 1h20m

**Thoughts:** This section made me pause and return a few seconds to really understand what is being discussed. The problem is that sometimes we underestimate things and we tend to be confident that we know things, but in reality, we don't. It's good to get back to the basics and do some exercises. In this section, we use the file system and command line arguments to create a note-taking app and work with JSON to store data. If it weren't for the 502 error in Udemy, I would have continued on the section. Tomorrow is another day.

### Day 3: May 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Node.js module system

**Thoughts:** This was an easy section for me since I have already an idea on how to use npm to install libraries in order for you to require it and use in the app. I like how detailed Andrew explained this section. I'm looking forward to go through the next sections.

### Day 2: May 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started digging into Node.js

**Thoughts:** Missing out a day especially when i'm still starting is not a great feeling. But it will not stop me from having progress. I will try not to miss a day again. Today, I had the chance to start digging into Node.js. Yesterday, I subscribed to Andrew Mead and Rob Percival [Complete Node.js developer course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) in Udemy.

### Day 1: May 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Managed to finish MERN stack tutorial to jumpstart this challenge

**Thoughts:** My goal was to just start on something without thinking too much which I noticed led me procrastinating in the end. I finished the tutorial in just a couple of hours since I have an idea about React already. I just want to test the waters using the MERN stack. I will dig deeper into Node.js and Express in the next few days. Not sure about MongoDB, though. I will also try to customize the app that was part of the tutorial.
