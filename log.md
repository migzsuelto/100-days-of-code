# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: May 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started digging into Node.js

**Thoughts:** Missing out a day especially when i'm still starting is not a great feeling. But it will not stop me from having progress. I will try not to miss a day again. Today, I had the chance to start digging into Node.js. Yesterday, I subscribed to Andrew Mead and Rob Percival [Complete Node.js developer course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) in Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Managed to finish MERN stack tutorial to jumpstart this challenge

**Thoughts:** My goal was to just start on something without thinking too much which I noticed led me procrastinating in the end. I finished the tutorial in just a couple of hours since I have an idea about React already. I just want to test the waters using the MERN stack. I will dig deeper into Node.js and Express in the next few days. Not sure about MongoDB, though. I will also try to customize the app that was part of the tutorial.
